Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?

- The application is designed to facilitate course registration for students. It allows users to select courses from a predefined list and register for them, ensuring they do not exceed a maximum credit limit. It addresses the user need for a straightforward, error-free registration process and provides feedback on registration status and errors.

What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

- I believe I did well with the implementation of clear validation logic to handle various scenarios such as duplicate registrations, exceeding credit limits, and invalid inputs. The user interface (UI) provides intuitive prompts and error messages, guiding users effectively through the registration process. Additionally, your use of switch statements and method encapsulation in the console application demonstrates good programming practices.

Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

-Console Application: It uses a text-based interface with prompts and messages displayed in the console window. Screenshots show clear communication of course registration status and errors directly through text.

-WPF Application: Offers a more visually appealing interface with interactive controls like ComboBoxes, Buttons, and ListBoxes. The UI elements are arranged logically to guide users through course selection and registration, with real-time updates of registered courses and total credit hours.

-Both designs focus on clarity and feedback, but the WPF application enhances user experience through graphical elements and interactive controls, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.

How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

- I used structured validation methods and error handling to identify and resolve issues like duplicate registrations and exceeding credit limits. In the future, these techniques can be expanded by implementing unit testing to validate each function's behavior independently. Additionally, logging and debugging tools can help track program flow and identify specific issues more efficiently.


Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

- I addressed challenges such as managing dynamic user input, maintaining program state across interactions, and providing clear feedback through both console and GUI interfaces. The integration of error messages and real-time updates in the WPF application particularly showcases innovative approaches to enhance user interaction and program functionality.
